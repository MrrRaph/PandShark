# PandShark 
## Author: [Raphael Dray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaeldray/)

PandShark is a tool designed to analyze/read pcap files.

It can parse from **PCAP** file format:

* **ARP**
* **DHCP**
* **DNS**
* **FTP**
* **HTTP**
* **ICMP**
* **ETHERNET**
* **TCP**
* **UDP**
* **IPV4**

Moreover, it includes a [protocol detection system](https://github.com/MrrRaph/PandShark/blob/master/src/core/headers/layer4/ProtocolDetector.java) 
in order to detect protocols encapsulated into TCP/UDP frames.

It includes also some PCAP samples to test different protocol detections.

## Installation:
You'll need to have Java 17 with preview enabled to run this program (--enable-preview).

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MrrRaph/PandShark.git
```

Then run the main class **PcapReader** in src.core.PcapReader.

## Usage:
PandShark give you a prompt in order to navigate through the packets:
```
