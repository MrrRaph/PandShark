PandShark is a tool designed to analyze/read pcap files.

It can parse from **PCAP** file format:

PandShark, in its minimal display, will always print:
* _Packet index_ (from the list of read packets)
* _IP/MAC address_
* _Protocol_
* _Packet Length_
* _Date_


* **ARP**
  * **Printed Fields**:
    * _ARP Info_ (i.e. Who has 24.166.175.220? Tell 69.76.216.1), useful for the comprehension.
* **DHCP**
  * _Printed Fields_:
    * _Message Type (Discover, Offer...)_, useful for understanding the request/response.
    * _Transaction ID_, useful for following the response/request.
* **DNS**
  * _Printed Fields_:
    * _DNS Query Type (i.e. Standard Query...)_, useful for understanding the type of the query.
    * _Query ID_, useful for following the response/request.
    * _Query Class_, useful for understanding the response needed to be given then.
    * _DNS Query Name_, useful for reading which server are we requesting.
      * For each **DNS Answers (A, AAAA, CNAME...)**:
        * Print the information about the answer
* **FTP**
  * _FTP Message with indication about Request/Response_, useful for reading the message sent and received.
* **HTTP**
  * _HTTP Message split on CRLF_, useful for reading the message sent and received.
* **ICMP**
  * **Printed Fields**:
    * _Type/Code Combination (i.e. Echo Reply/Echo Request)_, useful for determining the purpose of the ICMP packet.
    * _ID_, useful since the ID could reference in certain cases the PID of the process sending the packet.
    * _Sequence Number_, useful in order to determine if we lost packets.
    * _Time To Live_, useful in case you want to fingerprint the OS of the sender/receiver (**From IPV4**).
* **ETHERNET**
* **TCP**
* **UDP**
* **IPV4**

In its verbose mode (_display nth_), every protocol header about a specific 
packet and all their info are printed to visualize all fields.

Moreover, it includes a [protocol detection system](https://github.com/MrrRaph/PandShark/blob/master/src/core/headers/layer4/ProtocolDetector.java) 
in order to detect protocols encapsulated into TCP/UDP frames.

It includes also some PCAP samples to test different protocol detections.

## Installation:
You'll need to have Java 17 with preview enabled to run this program (--enable-preview).

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MrrRaph/PandShark.git
```

Then run the main class **PcapReader** in src.core.PcapReader.

## Usage:
Give a pcap as an argument to PandShark.

PandShark give you a prompt in order to navigate through the packets:
```
